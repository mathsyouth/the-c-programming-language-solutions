## Chapter 1. A Tutorial Introduction

* Exercise 1-9. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-9.c)
* Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \\t, each backspace by \\b, and each backslash by \\\\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-10.c)
* Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-12.c)
* Exercise 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientations is more challenging. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-13.c)
* Exercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-14.c)
* Exercise 1-15. Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-15.c)
* Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the lenght of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possilbe of the text. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-16.c)
* Exercise 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-17.c)
* Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entriely blank lines. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-18.c)
* Exercise 1-19. Write a function `reverse(s)` that reverses the character string `s`. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time. [solution](Chapter1/exercise1-19.c)
